  <p>Going back to the house analogy, lets say that the main.js is the house’s electrical wiring and control system hidden behind the walls, that powers the lights, air conditioning, machines, and more in all the rooms (pages), even thought you can't see the wires they work in the backgournd, trying to check if everything responds when you flip a switch or open a door, but while the homeowners was finishing up the wiring, they left some hidding maping (URL links) in the behind of the walls by accident, and someone could find thoses maps and lead to a place that wasn't ment to be seen.</p>
