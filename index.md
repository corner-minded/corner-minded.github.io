 <p>Before I start, I obtained Keylogger from a YouTube tutorial, As a beginner, I try to learn from resources that are readily available to me. That way, I can understand how things work on my own without constantly needing to seek help. So I have added 2 new modifications to impove on less confusion in the log, but too the point, this is a basic Keylogger that records keystrokes that have been pressed, this can be used of course to be hidden into a computer and log any sensitive information that was typed on said computer, like emails with passwords, private text messages, Bank info, and more. Here I will break down my simple code.</p>
